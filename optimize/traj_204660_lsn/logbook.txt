000: 

original dev script

001: 

attempt to replicate 000 with refactored code, use GS in the optimizer 

002: 

same as 001 - smooth transition with x poionts


003: 

only give it 2 points, starting and final equilibria


004:

use the gsdesign-based method with smoothing Ic at each iteration

005:

merge optimizer techniques and also use modified shape targets. 
Looks pretty good! t<0.15 is not great behavior. Also need to add 1 more
iteration on gsdesign first, and weights on targets.icx at tref.
