Some of the tokamak simulink models are now hard-coded to take a file called
"noise.mat" as input.  This file is expected to be in the matlab working directory.
The noise.mat file can be a file, or it can be a soft link to another pre-existing
noise file.

The noise file contains a matrix whose rows are time series.  Each row maps to a diagnostic
output from the simulink tokamak model.  More precisely, row i of the noise matrix
is the noise time series that is added to the i-1 diagnostic.  The offset in the
indexing is due to the requirement that first row of the noise matrix be a time
vector (that is to say, a vector of sample times).

The time row of the matrix must be monotonically increasing.  If the
simulink model time does not match a time vector entry, then the noise value
will be interpolated from the closest matrix times.

The noise.mat file can be generated a few ways.

How to generate a noise file:

Automated Method:
In the simulation working directory, run the function "make_noise".  This function 
generates a new noise file with a pathname specified in the arguments. A 
"noise.mat" soft link to the new file is then created in the working directory.

"make_noise" provides the option of creating a zero noise matrix when no noise is
desired in the model, or the ability to specify the sigma^2 variance for a Gaussian
white noise distribution for each diagnostic.

For a complete description, run "help make_noise" in Matlab.

Semi-automated Method:
Run "make_noise_file", then run "create_noise_link".  The arguments to 
"make_noise_file" are the same as the arguments to "make_noise", but 
"make_noise_file" does not create a "noise.mat" soft link.  That part 
is taken care of by "create_noise_link".

Non-automated Method:
Create a matrix in matlab whose specifications match the requirements above, 
then save the matrix to a .mat file.  You can either save the file as 
"noise.mat", or save it with an arbitrary name and create a "noise.mat" soft
link to it.
